# library_model

This is a model of a public library with library, shelf, and book objects.  Books are initialized with a title and author, and can be added and removed from certain shelves, but a given book can only exist on one shelf at a time.
Shelves are initialized with a name and store the books that have been added to them.
Libraries can have shelves added and removed without duplicates, and have a method to display every book in the library.
